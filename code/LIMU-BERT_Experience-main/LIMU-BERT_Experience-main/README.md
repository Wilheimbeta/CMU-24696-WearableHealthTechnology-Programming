## 📌 Introduction

**LIMU-BERT-X** presents the first real-world, nationwide deployment of a **human activity recognition (HAR)** foundation model in the on-demand food delivery industry. Built on the LIMU-BERT sensor foundation model, this project demonstrates how large-scale IMU data, self-supervised learning, and lightweight on-device inference can transform operational decision-making at massive scale.

Deployed with Ele.me over two years, LIMU-BERT-X now supports **500,000 couriers across 367 cities**, making **7.5 billion on-device predictions per day**. Leveraging **1.43 million hours of real-world sensor data** for pretraining and minimal labeled data, the system achieves **over 90% activity recognition accuracy** nationwide and powers multiple business-critical applications:

- 🚴 **Trajectory segmentation** for detecting riding, walking, and key delivery events  
- ⬆️ **Elevation change detection** using IMU-only modeling  
- ⏱️ **Improved ETA/ETS prediction**, reducing time estimation errors across millions of orders  
- 💰 **Dynamic and fair pricing**, contributing to **0.44 billion RMB annual cost savings**

This project has been accepted to 📄 **[MobiCom 2025 Experience Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3680207.3765261)** and we open-source the pretrained LIMU-BERT model—trained on **1.43 million hours** of sensor data from 60K couriers and 1.1K phone models—providing a strong foundation for future research in mobile sensing and ubiquitous computing.

This repository builds upon our earlier open-source implementation **[LIMU-BERT-Public](https://github.com/dapowan/LIMU-BERT-Public)**, which contains the official source code of our paper *[LIMU-BERT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3485730.3485937)*, published at 📄 **ACM SenSys 2021** and awarded 🏆 **Best Paper Runner-Up**. LIMU-BERT-X extends this foundation with large-scale real-world deployment, additional datasets, and industry-level model optimization.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WANDS-HKUST/LIMU-BERT_Experience.git
cd LIMU-BERT_Experience
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📘 Instructions

Before diving into this repository, we recommend readers have a basic understanding of **self-supervised learning** and the overall design philosophy behind LIMU-BERT. For background and foundational concepts, you may refer to:

- 📄 **[Our original LIMU-BERT paper (SenSys 2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3485730.3485937)** — introduces the core self-supervised learning framework for IMU sensing  
- 📄 **[Our latest experience paper (MobiCom 2025)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3680207.3765261)** — details the large-scale real-world deployment and commercial adoption of the model

### Training Workflow

In our framework, the training pipeline consists of **two phases**:

- **1. Self-Supervised Training Phase**:
Train **LIMU-BERT** using large-scale **unlabeled IMU data** with [`pretrain.py`](./pretrain.py). This phase learns generalizable IMU representations using contrastive and predictive objectives.

- **2. Supervised Training Phase**: Train a downstream **classifier** on labeled IMU data using the pretrained model with [`bert_classifier.py`](./bert_classifier.py). This phase adapts LIMU-BERT to specific tasks such as activity recognition.

As we have already pretrained **LIMU-BERT-X** using extensive unlabeled IMU data, the pretrained weights are provided in [`limu_bert_x.pt`](./weights/limu_bert_x.pt). You may **skip the self-supervised training phase** and directly use these pretrained weights for downstream tasks. Alternatively, you can **fine-tune LIMU-BERT-X on your own dataset** to better handle domain shift.

### Self-Supervised Training Phase (Optional)
Run [`pretrain.py`](./pretrain.py). Example:

```bash
python pretrain.py v4 hhar 20_120 -f limu_bert_x -s limu_pretrain 
```

This command fine-tunes LIMU-BERT-X using the configuration defined in the the _based_v4_ of [limu_bert.json](./config/limu_bert.json), with the hhar dataset "data_20_120.npy" and "label_20_120.npy". The trained model will be saved as "limu_pretrain.pt" in the _saved/pretrain_base_hhar_20_120_ folder. The mask and train settings are defined in the [mask.json](./config/mask.json) and [pretrain.json](./config/pretrain.json), respectively. After pretraining, copy `limu_pretrain.pt` to the `weights/` directory for subsequent fine-tuning.

Note that **LIMU-BERT-X** uses a sequence length of **20**, which is different from the original **LIMU-BERT**, which uses a sequence length of **120**.

### Supervised Training Phase
Run [`bert_classifier.py`](./pretrain.py). Example:

Example:
```
python bert_classifier.py v4_v2 hhar 20_120 -f limu_pretrain -s hhar_classifier -l 2
```
For this command, we will train a composite classifier with the pretrained LIMU-BERT-X and GRU classifier. The pretrained model is specified by `-f limu_pretrain`. If you skip the self-supervised training phase, you may replace it with `-f limu_bert_x`.
, The settings of the classifier are defined in the _gru_v2_ of [`classifier.json`](./config/classifier.json), while train hyperparameters are defined in the [`bert_classifier_train.json`](./config/bert_classifier_train.json). 
Note that `v4_v2` specifies two model versions, corresponding to the LIMU-BERT backbone and the GRU classifier, respectively. The trained LIMU-GRU classifier will be saved as "hhar_classifier.pt" in the _saved/bert_classifier_base_uci_20_120_ folder.
